# SpaceApps2021
Welcome to our starmazing board game by the Penguins of Callisto! This project is a board game made to address the NASA SpaceApps2021 challenge titled "Space Quest: The Game". Please see our [Wiki page](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki) for all details about our game, including drafts of the components.

## Who are we?

Lynn Stanwyck is a 4th year medical student at Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who is interested in the intersections of space and medicine!
Claudia Perez is a Master's student in Biological Sciences who loves board games and space!


## Our Idea: Otherworldly Explorers
We developed a board game as a solution to the "Space Quest: The Game" challenge. In this game you are a company and your goal is to create positive public perception by successfully launching and completing science mission. We decided that we wanted to impact a broad audience, our goal being middle schoolers or older, with a small time investment. The game should take about 10 minutes to learn and 45 minutes to play. We believe not only is a fun way to learn about what it takes to explore space and perform research, but will also will teach important life skill such as problem solving, communication skiils and the importance of failures. Enjoy!

Hi! We’re Claudia and Lynn of the Penguins of Callisto. We chose to hack Space Quest: The Game. We’re here to prove that board games are a great format for teaching, while having fun. Gen Con is the largest board game convention in North America and been running annually since 1967. In 2019 there were 70,000 attendees and 538 exhibitors! Board gaming has expanded beyond a hobby, it now reaches deeper into other realms, like the classroom.

Our game is called Otherworldly Explorers. The goal of the game is to increase public interest in space science by performing outreach and completing missions. We’re designing it to be easy to pick up and quick to play. A game should take about 45 minutes. Players prepare for missions at different locations on Earth. These locations include Mission Headquarters, the Research Center, Media and Communications, and Engineering, which is where Launch Pad is located. When a rocket is ready, it travels through space and encounters some space event. Afterwards, the rocket is on the destination side of the board. Here we’ve demoed Jupiter and its 4 Galilean moons. All of our cards have details and fun facts sourced mostly from NASA websites and datasets. We’ve included lots of information about real-life missions of the past, present, and future. Our Technology cards give emphasis to the kinds of tools required to study different aspects of space science. Our Media cards showcase the many ways you can communicate science to the public.  

We want people to sit down together and have fun while learning amazing things about the world and universe around us. We hope that every player gets excited about the space research going on around the world, because they can definitely get involved themselves! Check out our [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki) for more details!

Our game has been designed to be easily picked up and played. Most of the text is not necessary for gameplay, so if you just want to sit and play, you can. However, we highly recommend engaging with the game more because the text adds a lot of cool background information and depth to the game. For example, you may have a mission that involves a mass spectrometer, and the text about how it works, in what cases it can be used, and what data it provides, could make you want to learn more about the instrument. The game will have multiple destinations, each with many mission cards, so it is highly replayable. Expansions can be added with even more destinations, missions, technologies, corporations, events, and media outreach cards. New gameplay mechanisms can be added through expansions as well. 

At this point, we have digital demo verions of all card types, and the Jupiter destination components. We also have draft physical versions of these items, that aren't as detailed, but allow us to move the pieces around as a player would. These physical drafts are mostly paper and board game components from other games. 


## Our Hackaton Journey

How would you describe your Space Apps experience? What did you learn? What inspired your team to choose this challenge? What was your approach to developing this project? How did your team resolve setbacks and challenges? Is there anyone you'd like to thank and why?

Our hackthon journey started at a rugby game--at least that's we decided to become a team off the field. We both love space and board games so looking the different challenges, saw "Space Quest: The Game" and knew what we were doing with our next weekend.

When the hackthathon started we knew we wanted our game to impact a wide audience (we decided on middle school and older), have a small time investment (we estimate about 10 minutes to learn and 45 minutes to play), to be highly educational (all our cards have real facts about technology, past or future mission, or space research), and most of all to be fun! We started by pulled out all our board games for inspiration: Pandemic, Lift Off, Terraforming Mars, Horrified, Cytosis, Ticket to Ride and more! It was quite a mess. We thought about what type of experinece we wanted players to have. Should the compete or corrporate? Was it going to be a card game? A tile placing game? An adventure game? We decided on a mix, with, of course, a focus on eduvation. 

Next came the hard part, what place in space did we want to explore? There were so many options and we couldn't just pick just one! So we didn't: we decided that we would demo with one destination, [Jupiter and its moons](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Destinations), but plan to create more space destinations and even consider expansion packs once the base game was finished. Check out our [ideas for the future](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/The-Future) in the Wiki. Once we had the basics down, it was time to start drafting a compnents and a board.

We started with paper, notecards and components stolen from our other board games to draft a physical board and move peices around to determine the flow. Once we had worked out the set up, cards we need, and other logistics it was time to start drafting the our different components. As you can see in our Wiki site and demo videos, we had many compnents to draft: [the overall board](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki), [the Jupiter destination senario](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Destinations), [Mission Cards](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Missions-Cards), [Space Event Cards](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Space-Event-Cards), [Research Items](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Research-Item-Cards), [media cards](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Earth#media-cards), and [the rule book](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki/Rule-Book).

Drafting these components was exhausting but also fascinating! We learned so much reading about data set from past and future mission. We learned about how to drill for rock samples on Mars and ice samples on Europa. We learned about lidar--that was my favorite. We learned about the Galieo missions, planetary protection, space trash and more! There was a lot to learn, synthesize and add to cards but we loved it!

Next it was time to make the demo. We had no idea how hard it is to explain 2 days of work into 30 seconds, but we did it! And then promptly decided we needed to do second video to explain everything we wanted to say in 30 seconds but could not. Finally we we turned here, to the GitHub, to compile everything together so that you could explore our starmazing board game! Thanks for a great hack!

Thanks to our local lead, Fig O'Reilly, for her guidance and for answering all our questions. Thank you also to the subject matter experts, espeically Henry Throop and Delia Santiago-Materese, for helping guide us to data set and content to support our game!
