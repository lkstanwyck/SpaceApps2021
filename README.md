# SpaceApps2021
Welcome to our starmazing board game by the Penguins of Callisto! This project is a board game made to address the NASA SpaceApps2021 challenge titled "Space Quest: The Game". Please see our [Wiki page](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki) for all details about our game, including drafts of the components.

## Who are we?

Lynn Stanwyck is a 4th year medical student at Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine who is interested in the intersections of space and medicine!
Claudia Perez is a Master's student in Biological Sciences who loves board games and space!


## Our Idea: Otherworldly Explorers
We developed a board game as a solution to the "Space Quest: The Game" challenge. In this game you are a company and your goal is to create positive public perception by successfully launching and completing science mission. We decided that we wanted to impact a broad audience, our goal being middle schoolers or older, with a small time investment. The game should take about 10 minutes to learn and 45 minutes to play. We believe not only is a fun way to learn about what it takes to explore space and perform research, but will also will teach important life skill such as problem solving, communication skiils and the importance of failures. Enjoy!

## Demo

Hi! We’re Claudia and Lynn of the Penguins of Callisto. We chose to hack Space Quest: The Game. We’re here to prove that board games are a great format for teaching, while having fun. Gen Con is the largest board game convention in North America and been running annually since 1967. In 2019 there were 70,000 attendees and 538 exhibitors! Board gaming has expanded beyond a hobby, it now reaches deeper into other realms, like the classroom.

Our game is called Otherworldly Explorers. The goal of the game is to increase public interest in space science by performing outreach and completing missions. We’re designing it to be easy to pick up and quick to play. A game should take about 45 minutes. Players prepare for missions at different locations on Earth. These locations include Mission Headquarters, the Research Center, Media and Communications, and Engineering, which is where Launch Pad is located. When a rocket is ready, it travels through space and encounters some space event. Afterwards, the rocket is on the destination side of the board. Here we’ve demoed Jupiter and its 4 Galilean moons. All of our cards have details and fun facts sourced mostly from NASA websites and datasets. We’ve included lots of information about real-life missions of the past, present, and future. Our Technology cards give emphasis to the kinds of tools required to study different aspects of space science. 

We want people to have fun while learning amazing things about the world and universe around us. Check out our [GitHub Wiki page](https://github.com/lkstanwyck/SpaceApps2021/wiki) for more details!
