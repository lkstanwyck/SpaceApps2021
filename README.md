## Our Idea
Povide a high-level summary of your project. What did you develop? How does it "solve" the challenge? Why is it important?
Our goal was to create a fun board game that was also very educational about space and what it takes to explore space and do research. We decided that we wanted to reach a broad audience, our goal being middle schoolers or older, with a small time investment
